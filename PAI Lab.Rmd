At the 2023 annual conference of the International Communication Association, I had the opportunity to moderate a panel on managing lab research. Autumn Edwards, Grace Sun Joo Ahn, Matthew Lombard, and Tony Liao shared their lab management and research experience, which sparked the establishment of my own lab – the Presence and Artificial Intelligence (PAI) Lab. 

The PAI Lab aims at conducting research on users’ perceptions of, interactions with, and evaluations of presence-evoking emerging technologies, such as social robots, virtual agents, chatbots, virtual reality, and augmented reality. The PAI Lab also delves into topics, including explainable AI (XAI), Science and Technology Studies (STS), and ubiquitous computing. 

Revolving around both the science and the methods of artificial intelligence, our lab seeks to conduct theoretically robust and methodologically innovative research. 

Drawing on an analogy with the pronunciation and significance of “π”, our lab symbolizes the commitment to exploring infinite and non-recurring possibilities for emerging technology research.

We conduct research at the University of Florida, with the support of the technologies such as
