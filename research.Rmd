In the past few years, my primary research has been centering on the concepts of social cues and social presence in human-computer interaction and computer-mediated communication. I am especially interested in how various combinations of social cues evoke users' social responses to social robotic technologies or technology-mediated social actors in VR or AR environments.

[1] Testing the framework of the Computers are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm;

[2] Testing the framework of the Media are Social Actors paradigm as an extension of the CASA paradigm; 

[3] Testing a framework about the categorization and interaction of social cues and social presence;

[4] Computational studies and media effects studies.

Clifford Nass and his colleagues proposed the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm in the 1990s and found that humans treat computers in some of the ways we treat humans. This first line of research applies this paradigm to explain more emerging technologies including social robots, chatbots, and other forms of AI-technologies. My coauthors and I use various methods (e.g., computational, systematic review, experiments) to test the validity of the paradigm and its concomitant counterarguments.

The MASA paradigm is an extension and an attempt to update the CASA paradigm. To account for technological advances and to refine explanations for CASA results, my coauthors and I begin by distinguishing the roles of primary and secondary cues in evoking users' social presence and social responses to technologies. We then discuss the roles of individual differences and contextual factors in these responses and unify mindless and mindful anthropomorphism as two major complementary mechanisms for understanding various MASA phenomena. Based on evolutionary psychology explanations for socialness, we conclude with nine formal propositions and suggestions for future research to test and apply MASA. The foundation for building the MASA paradigm is set upon the idea that being social means being interdependent and cooperative. Humans not only have a social brain and a social way of living, but also develop evolution-based flexibility to adapt to new human-computer interaction styles.

Since the advent of computing machines, scholars have theorized about the relationship between humans and computers, how people interact with computers, how people interact with one another utilizing computers, and the implications of these machines for the society. Computer-mediated communication (CMC) and human-computer interaction (HCI) are two fields that have made important contributions in understanding the role of computers in communication. With the rise of new multimedia, multisensory, and interactive computing systems, this line of research suggests that theories from these fields need to be integrated to inform research about the new media environment. We first provide an overview of how CMC and HCI have evolved in the past few decades. Secondly, we propose a typology of how these fields have conceptualized key concepts like cues and social presence that can help researchers parse out ways of approaching new media technologies. Lastly, we examine several ways that new computing technologies including chatbots, computer agents, telepresence robots, and virtual/augmented reality illuminate a need to draw from both perspectives in the discourse regarding humans and computers.

While my primary focus has been centered on social robotics, virtual and augmented technologies, I have been interested in some other media-related phenomena such as binge-watching, location-based mobile social networks, globalization, visual analyses, and media dependency. Here I am listing some other research that concentrates on these topics.
